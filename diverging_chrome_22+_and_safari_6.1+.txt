Here is another one that I have been working on for some time.


At this time 6.1 (and 7) of Safari are able to be separated by CSS from Chrome 22+ (tested up to version 28)

The Safari 6.1+ hack I worked out already is the key:


/* Safari 6.1+  */


@media screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio:0) and (min-color-index:0) {
   .selector {(; property:value; );} 
}


I came up with this one that works for Chrome 22+:


/* Chrome 22+ */


@media screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio:0) and (min-resolution: .001dpcm),
   screen and(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio:0) { 
      _::content, .selector { property:value; } 
}



It will be interesting to see how iOS 8 and OS X 10.10 Yosimite handle these...
