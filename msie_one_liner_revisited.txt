it used to be that a few star and underscore hacks would target most ie versions in one css one-liner.

this should target all of them in this order: 
( ie11:blue, ie9-10:green, ie8:purple, ie7:orange, ie6:pink, anything else: black )

.msiecolors { color:black;color:blue\0;color:green\9;color:purple \9;+color:orange;_color:pink; }

/* the next one sets msie 10 to red (escape hack combined with \9 targets only msie 10) */

html[lang='\
en'] .msiecolors { color:red\9; }

so after this, it should now be as follows...
MSIE colors: ( ie11:blue, ie10:red, ie9:green, ie8:purple, ie7:orange, ie6:pink, anything else: black )

<div class=msiecolors> msie color test </div>
