Both of these work for internet explorer 11 and newer:


_::-ms-backdrop, body:last-child .selector { }

_::-ms-backdrop, .selector:not([attr*='']) { } 


I came up with this set when I was working on the firefox hacks and msie 10 hacks that are similar.

Also submitted this to the browserhacks forum.
