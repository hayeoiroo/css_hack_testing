Here are some css media query hack tests I have been conducting to isolate various versions of Firefox. 
I have submitted most of these to browserhacks.com for inclusion.

Here is one I created to target Firefox 21+: (2 methods)


_::-moz-range-track, body:last-child .selector { } 

_::-moz-range-track, .selector:not([attr*='']) { } 


and another one: (again 2 methods)


/* Firefox 16+: */

_::-moz-progress-bar, body:last-child .selector { }

_::-moz-progress-bar, .selector:not([attr*='']) { }



both of these next ones I created work for firefox 22 and newer: 


@supports (-moz-appearance:meterbar) and (display:flex) { .selector { } }

@supports (-moz-appearance:meterchunk) and (display:flex) { .selector { } }



I Submitted these to browserhacks (firefox 8+ hacks are now posted on browserhacks.com)



Firefox 8+ (2 working media query hacks):


@media all and (min--moz-device-pixel-ratio:0) and (min-resolution: .001dpcm) { .selector { } }

@media all and (-moz-images-in-menus:0) and (min-resolution: .001dpcm) { .selector { } }


Firefox 3-


@media \0 all { body:last-child .selector { color:red; } }


notes: 

media \0 all { }

-also works for MSIE 8 without the 'body:last-child' combination

guillaume-simons posted a few css hacks to the forum, I modified them to target just Firefox:

@supports (-moz-appearance:meterbar) and (cursor:zoom-in) { .selector { } } - Firefox 24+
@supports (-moz-appearance:meterbar) and (background-attachment:local) { .selector { color:red; } } - Firefox 25+
@supports (-moz-appearance:meterbar) and (image-orientation:90deg) { .selector { } } - Firefox 26+
@supports (-moz-appearance:meterbar) and (all:initial) { .selector { } } - Firefox 27+
@supports (-moz-appearance:meterbar) and (list-style-type:japanese-formal) { .selector { } } - Firefox 28+
@media all and (min--moz-device-pixel-ratio:0) and (min-resolution:3e1dpcm) { .selector { } } - Firefox 29+ [this one already is firefox alone and works well]
@supports (-moz-appearance:meterbar) and (background-blend-mode:difference,normal) { .selector { } } - Firefox 30+
