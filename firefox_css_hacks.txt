Here are some css media query hack tests I have been conducting to isolate Firefox < 3 and check for Firefox > 4 

- here are my combined results: - -Jeff- -

new ones!

both of these I just created work for firefox 22 and newer: 

@supports (-moz-appearance:meterbar) and (display:flex)
{ 
   .selector 
   { 
      color:red; 
   } 
}


@supports (-moz-appearance:meterchunk) and (display:flex)
{ 
   .selector 
   { 
      color:red; 
   } 
}


I Submitted these to browserhacks (firefox 8+ hacks are now posted on browserhacks.com)



Firefox 8+ (2 working media query hacks):


@media all and (min--moz-device-pixel-ratio:0) and (min-resolution: .001dpcm)
{
   .selector { color:red }
}


@media all and (-moz-images-in-menus:0) and (min-resolution: .001dpcm)
{
   .selector { color:red; }
}


Firefox 3-


@media \0 all
{
   body:last-child .selector { color:red; }
}


notes: 

media \0 all { }

-also works for MSIE 8 without the 'body:last-child' combination
