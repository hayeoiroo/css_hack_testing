Firefox 31 is the first browser to support CSS3 Variables,
so here are my first CSS hacks using them.

Just make sure that you use a different variable in each definition.
They really are variables, not constants, so they can override each other.

/* Firefox 31+ (CSS3 Variable Method) */

_:-moz-tree-row(hover), .selector {
    --this-variable:value; property:var(--this-variable);
}

And using a supports methodâ€¦

/* Firefox 31+ (CSS3 Variable Method) */

@supports (-moz-appearance:meterbar) {
    .selector {
       --this-variable:value; property:var(--this-variable);
    }
}

Other browsers are supposed to follow suit, but for now just Firefox 31 and newer.
